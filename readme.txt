This repository contains the code used for the numerical experiments in the paper "On a class of high dimensional linear regression methods with debiasing and thresholding." Running these scripts reproduces or closely approximates the key results presented in the paper.

All computations were performed on a Dell workstation equipped with an Intel Core i7-12850HX CPU at 2.10 GHz and 32.00 GB RAM, using Python 3.12.4 or MATLAB R2022b. Specifically, the Bootstrap code, written in Python, was executed on a workstation with an Intel Xeon Platinum 8358P CPU at 2.60 GHz and 512.00 GB RAM, using Python 3.12.2.
